# 🌱 Environmental Scientist and Former Farmer turned Code Ninja 🚀

Hey there! I'm Owen Lang, a wanderer at heart with a background in environmental science and policy. After graduating from Loyola Chicago, I spent six months roaming across Europe, working on farms, and soaking up the beauty of sustainable living. 🌍

For the past year and a half, I've been getting my hands dirty (literally) at a Community Supported Agriculture farm in Puyallup, Washington, where I cultivated not just crops but a passion for coding. 🌾💻

Fresh out of Coding Dojo, I've added MERN, Python, C#/.NET, and many other frameworks and tools to my toolkit. I'm excited to blend my love for tech with my green roots. 🌱

Currently on the hunt for an entry-level opportunity in programming or software development. My coding journey may be new, but my dedication and knack for problem-solving are seasoned. 💪

Beyond the screen, I bring a unique mix of environmental consciousness, teamwork and time sensitive problem-solving ability from farm life, and the analytical mind of a coder. Let's create a sustainable future—one line of code at a time. 🌈

Open to collaborations, mentorship, and good vibes. Let's grow and code together! 🌱💻
